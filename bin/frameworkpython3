# On OSX, two different types of Python builds exist: a regular build and
# a framework build. In order to interact correctly with some GUI
# frameworks, you need to use a framework build. Unfortuantly, on OSX
# virtualenv always uses a regular build.
#
# The best known workaround, borrowed from the WX wiki, is to use the non-
# virtualenv Python along with the PYTHONHOME environment variable.
# See: http://matplotlib.org/faq/virtualenv_faq.html#osx
